# heapq — extra

`heapq` also contains general purpose functions: `merge`, `nlargest` and `nsmallest`.
Guido van Rossum used the first one in his [10-year-old article](http://neopythonic.blogspot.ru/2008/10/sorting-million-32-bit-integers-in-2mb.html), which one of the readers sent me today.

Feel free to do the same — @pushtaev.
